/** ~~~~~~~ FOR LEARNING PURPOSE ~~~~~~~
 * The folder 'my_app' only contains files
 * which can be directly used as App.js.
 * Just change the name of any file her to
 * App.js, keep at right path (one folder back),
 * correct imports and maybe a couple of errors,
 * then run directly.
 * 
 * File names follow pattern
 * A00_Vid_Num_App_Topic.js
 * e.g. Vid_011_App_EventAndFunc.js
 * i.e. Tutorial's Video 11's App.js, which teaches using 'Topic' Events and Function.
 * 
 * The components used in any of these files
 * are kept under folder 'component' with similar
 * file name pattern.
 * i.e. the App.js with name 'Vid_008_App...'
 * will use component(s) name starting with 'Vid_008_...' if that/those exist(s),
 * e.g. Vid_008_App.js uses component file Vid_008_FunctionComp.js
 * 
 * An App.js file may also use more components than matching name one.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * ----
 * Vid_001_015_App...js means ththat this App.js
 *      => is being used for examples in Video 1 to Video 15, refer to videos for info.
