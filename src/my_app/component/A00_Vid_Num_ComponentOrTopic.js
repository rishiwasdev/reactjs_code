/** ~~~~~~~ FOR LEARNING PURPOSE ~~~~~~~
 * The folder 'component' only contains files which contain
 * one or more components which are directly being used in
 * App.js file(s) or other component(s).
 *
 * File names follow pattern A00_Vid_Num_ComponentOrTopic.js. E.g. Vid_008_FunctionComp.js
 * => Tutorial's Video 8 teaches this 'Component/Topic' i.e. Function Component.
 *
 * Strong possibility (unless otherwise some code is modified later):
 * ------------------
 * Component from Vid_001_Component will be used in an App.js file, whose
 * name starts with Vid_001_App...js (possibly kept in folder named 'my_app' or similar).
 * => Vid_001_App...js      <USES OMPONENT IN>       Vid_001_Component.js
 *
 * A component may use other component(s) too.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * ----
 * Vid_001_015_ComponentName.js mean the component 'ComponentName'
 *      => is being used in Vid_001_App...js files to Vid_015_App...js
 *      => refer to Video 1 to Video 15 for info.
