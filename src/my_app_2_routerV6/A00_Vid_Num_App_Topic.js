/** ~~~~~~~ FOR LEARNING PURPOSE ~~~~~~~
 * The folder 'my_app_2_routerV6' only contains files which can be directly used as App.js.
 * Just change the name of any file her to App.js, keep at right path (one folder back),
 * correct imports and maybe a couple of errors, then run directly.
 * 
 * All files in this folder are for tutorials on React Router version 6.
 * 
 * File names follow pattern A00_Vid_Num_App_Topic.js e.g. Vid_050_App_404NotFound.js
 * i.e. Tutorial's Video 50's App.js, which teaches using 'Topic' 404 Page Not Found.
 * 
 * The components used in any of these files are kept under folder
 * 'component_2_router' with similar file name pattern.
 * i.e. the App.js with name 'Vid_008_App...' will use component(s) name starting with 'Vid_008_...' if that/those exist(s).
 * 
 * An App.js file may also use more components than matching name one, as needed.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * ----
 * Vid_001_15_App...js means that this App.js
 *      => is being used for examples in Video 1 to Video 15, refer to videos for info.
